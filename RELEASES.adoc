== SourceBuddy Release history


=== link:https://github.com/sourcebuddy/sourcebuddy/tree/2.0.0[2.0.0]

Major restructuring of the class loading structure.
With this release hidden and non-hidden classes can be mixed.
There is no more `loadHidden()` method supported.
Instead, you can call `hidden()` for each added source separately.

Since this change, removing a method from the API? is not backward compatible, this is a new major version.
